Manual Testing Guideline for Star Battle:
(This page should be integrated with the mocha test cases later)

1. Covers servers:
    Visit localhost:8789/echo => Assert they are running

2. Covers drawing and /getpuzzle api:
    Request for an empty puzzle at localhost:8789/getpuzzle => assert that the drawing renders correctly

3. Covers eventListener: 
    click on the cells multiple times => assert that the stars are toggling properly

4. Covers Puzzle ADT isComplete():
    Reach a winning position in the board => assert that a notification is generated properly 
   
(We may need to create a small puzzle for the ease of manual testing)
